Summary
-------

This set of programs allows one to identify transposable element insertions (TEI) in a sequenced sample with respect to an assembled reference. 

The main script jitterbug.py performs this analysis, using a .bam file of mapped reads and the annotation of TEs in the reference.

Additional modules are provided to filter and plot these results, compare tumor/normal pairs as well evaluate predictions from simulated data.

## USE CASE 1: predict TEI in a single sample


### STEP 1.1: run jitterbug.py to identify the candidate TE insertions:

example usage: run with bam file, default everything, write to present directory

    jitterbug.py sample.bam te_annot.gff3

example usage: run with bam file, write to specified directory with specified prefix. Parallelize: use 8 threads, separating by 50 Kbp bins 

    jitterbug.py --numCPUs 8  --bin_size 50000000 --output_prefix /path/to/my/dir/prefix sample.bam te_annot.gff3

example usage: you have added nice unique identifier tags to your gff annotation (like in the hg19 and TAIR10 annotations provided in the data/ folder) and you want those to be reported in the final output. 

    jitterbug.py --TE_name_tag Name --numCPUs 8  --bin_size 50000000 --output_prefix /path/to/my/dir/prefix sample.bam te_annot.gff3

                        skip the step of perusing the input bam for discordant
                        reads

```


this will generate the following output files:

    <output_prefix>.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.gff3
Annotation in gff3 format of the predicted insertions, with the 9th column's tags describing characteristics of the predictions
    
    <output_prefix>.read_stats.txt
Stats collected on the library: length and standard deviations of the fragments and reads
    
    <output_prefix>.filter_config.txt
Config file with reasonable defaults for the subsequent highly recommended filtering step. These defaults are calculated as a function of the library characteristics
    
    <output_prefix>.run_stats.txt
Stats collected about the run: calculation time, number of processors used
    
    <output_prefix>.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.supporting_clusters.table
Table with infomation on the reads that support each cluster. This table is intended to be easily manipulated with standard *NIX tools in order to, for example, extract the anchor and mate read's sequences for assembly and primer design

The table follows the following format:

Insertion lines: one per predicted insertion site, corresponding to a pair of overlapping clusters, one fwd, one rev

    I       cluster_pair_ID lib     chrom   start   end     num_fwd_reads   num_rev_reads   fwd_span        rev_span        best_sc_pos_st  best_sc_pos_end sc_pos_support

Cluster lines (two per insertion, one fwd and one rev):

    C       cluster_pair_ID lib     direction       start   end     chrom   num_reads       span
 
Read lines (fwd reads consitute the fwd clusters, rev reads the rev clusters)
 the reads' status can be "anchor": those that consitute the cluster, or "mate": are the anchors' mates, which map to a TE

    R       cluster_pair_ID lib     direction       interval_start  interval_end    chrom   status  bam_line


### STEP 1.2: filter results

We recommend you filter the results generated by the previous step 
- to eliminate insertions with poor support
- to eliminate insertions which overlap with Ns in your reference

The first step selects high-confidence insertions based on a set of metrics (see figure Supp2A in related publication). Depending on your application, you might want to have more relaxed filtering criteria: to be sure to recover as many true insertions as possible, knowing those come with more FP, or be stricter and have less TP but with higher confidence. 
The filter_config.txt file output in the first step is automatically generated with reasonable defaults for the given sequencing library. 
these defaults are:
2 < cluster size < 5*coverage
2 < span < mean fragment length
mean read length < interval length < 2*(isize_mean + 2*isize_sdev - (rlen_mean - rlen_sdev))
2 < softclipped support < 5*coverage
pick consistent: name annotation

The second step eliminates false positives that are due to a poorly assembled region. Our experience is that repetitive sequences tend to be more difficult to assemble, and N islands in a draft assembly are often unassembled transposons. For that reason, insertions spanning Ns are likely not insertions in the sample, but absence in the reference sequence of a TE common to both the reference and the sample.

example:

jitterbug_filter_results_func.py -g sample.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.gff3 -c sample.filter_config.txt -o sample.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.filtered.gff3

intersectBed -a sample.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.filtered.gff3 -b N_annot.gff3 -v > sample.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.filtered.noNs.gff3

(intersectBed is part of the BedTools suite, which you can download at https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2)

usage: jitterbug_filter_results_func.py [-h] [-g GFF] [-c CONFIG] [-o OUTPUT]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g GFF, --gff GFF     file in gff3 format of TEI generated by Jitterbug
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        config file with filtering parameters, generated by
                        Jitterbug
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        name of output file






## USE CASE 2 : looking for somatic insertions in a tumor/normal pair

Included in this package is a module that performs the comparison of a ND/TD pair of samples. 

### STEP 2.1: run Jitterbug on ND and TD samples separately

Run Jitterbug and filter results as described above. 

### STEP 2.2: Identify insertions present in TD which are absent in ND

The goal is to identify somatic insertions: that are present in the tumor sample (ND) and absent from the normal sample (TD). This is done in two steps: 

- take the high-confidence predictions (ie, filtered) from TD and compare them to the whole set (ie, unfiltered) of ND TEI. 

- for those that remain, inspect the ND bam to be sure that the absence of that TEI is not due to low coverage, or to a FP. more than 1% discordant reads in a 200bp window around that locus is taken to be a FP. 

example:

    process_ND_TD.py --TD_F tumor.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.filtered.noNs.gff3 --ND normal.TE_insertions_paired_clusters.gff3 -b normal.bam -o tumor.somatic.TEI.gff3

```
usage: process_ND_TD.py [-h] [--TD_F TD_F] [--ND ND] [-b ND_BAM]
                        [-o OUTPUT_PREFIX]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --TD_F TD_F           file in gff3 format of TEI (generated by Jitterbug) in
                        TUMOR sample, FILTERED
  --ND ND               file in gff3 format of TEI (generated by Jitterbug) in
                        NORMAL sample, NOT FILTERED
  -b ND_BAM, --ND_bam ND_BAM
                        bam file of mapped reads from NORMAL sample
  -o OUTPUT_PREFIX, --output_prefix OUTPUT_PREFIX
                        prefix for output file

```

the output are:
- pdf venn diagrams of the intersections of TD filtered and ND unfiltered (Tf and N)
- a gff file annotating the insertions present in Tf but not in N, as well as a table that consists of the same gff annotations followed by a few columns describing the sequence context (+/- 100 bp) surrounding the insertion interval: counting repetitive reads, discordant reads, etc (the header line of the file explains these columns)

the last column is a flag: PUTATIVE-SOM if less than 50% of the reads in that interval are not discordant (meaning it might be a somatic insertion in the tumor) and NON-SOM if not


Known issues
------------

- Large input bams (>40X coverage for the human genome) can lead to high memory usage. To avoid this, you can pre-filter your bam to extract only discordant read pairs using Samtools (https://samtools.github.io/). You must then sort and index them, and you are ready to feed that bam to Jitterbug. 

```
    samtools view -b -F 1294 sample.bam > sample.discordants.unsorted.bam
    samtools sort sample.discordants.unsorted.bam sample.discordants 
```

this generates a file named sample.discordants.bam

     samtools index sample.discordants.bam

- Jitterbug only accepts GFF3 format TE annotations. If you have an annotation in BED format, you can convert it using: (assuming the fourth column is the name)

```
awk 'BEGIN{OFS="\t"}{print $1, ".", ".", $2, $3, ".", "+" , "." , "Name="$4}' annot.bed > annot.gff3
```

## Possible subsequent analyses


### Verify inserts by PCR and/or sequence the inserted TE


 Once you have predicted TEI in your sample, you might want to verify them by PCR. We recommend assembling the discordant reads that predicted a given insertion to reconstruct the border of the TE and the sequence flanking it's insertion site in order to design primers. Indeed, there might be a few SNPs between your sample and the reference that would not impede mapping of the read but that would preclude binding of the oligo. 

To do that, you can:

- extract the reads consisting the forward and reverse clusters:

for a a cluster id X, do:
```
less sample.table | awk '$1 == "R"' | grep -w X | grep fwd | awk '{print ">"$2"_"$4"_"$8"_"$12"\n"$19}'> clusterX.fwd.reads.fa
less sample.table | awk '$1 == "R"' | grep -w X | grep rev | awk '{print ">"$2"_"$4"_"$8"_"$12"\n"$19}'> clusterX.rev.reads.fa
```
we then recommend assembling these with a program such as CAP3 (http://doua.prabi.fr/software/cap3)

you can then design primers flanking the insert (p1,p4) and within the insert (p2,p3)

```
FWD cluster assembly                                                  REV cluster assembly 
================_genome_===================########_TE_#########  //  ####_TE_##############===========_genome_===================
                                >>p1>>           <<p2<<                            >>p3>>     <<p4<<                  
```
p1/p2 or p3/p4 can be used to verify the presence of the insert

p1/p4 can be used to:
- check for the presence of the absence allele: if the length of the amplified product corresponds to that of their distance in the reference
- sequence the insert (PCR has to be adjusted for long amplicons)


### Identify target site duplications:

To identify target site duplications, you can extract and assemble the reads as described above and then scan them for direct repeats that occur just once at the predicted insertion site.
